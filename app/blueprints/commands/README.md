## Background process.

Self contained flask blueprint that
creates a simple app to run a background process
and display the results.

If you don't want any of this just delete this directory...

Build the app with:

```bash
npx node app/blueprints/commands/src/build.mjs -- --watch
```

Goto the app with `/command`

This is a proof of concept of creating an isolated flask blueprint
with svelte javascript.
